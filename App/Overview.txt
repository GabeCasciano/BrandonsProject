 --- Jetson:
The jetson is responsible for identifying when it sees a person, and classifying
the person that it has seen.

The jetson begins by creating a udp socket, and connects to the server, it will first
associate its key with the server, the key will be used at the start of every udp
packet to ensure that the server can tell who is communicating to it.


 --- Server:
The server is responsible for keeping track of who is on site, and communicating
with the jetson and the client.

The server will begin by loading in its data from a file, it will then listen to its
udp socket which the jetson and client will use to communicate to the server. The server
will listen for the key of associated jetsons, it will associate a tag with the specified
IP addr so the jetson can be identifier.

When the server receives a correct ID from an associated jetson it will update the
specified person on whether or not they are present on site. If the ID does not exist
the server will create a new Person and keep track of them.

When the server will also service the client, the client will request peoples information
over the same udp socket, such that they can indicate to the end user who is on site.
